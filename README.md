# slack++
c++ slack ncurses client

Slack++ is gonna be rewritten in Qt.
In master you'll find ncurses version while Qt version is not ready; 
when we think the qt version reaches a good shape, we'll move it to master and remove previous ncurses based application.

To build master you need: 

* rapidjson
* curlpp
* cmake

and a fairly recent c++ compiler.
It was tested on Archlinux and MacOS 10.10.
